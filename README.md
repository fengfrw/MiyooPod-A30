## Installation

1. Download [MiyooPod.zip](https://github.com/danfragoso/miyoopod/raw/refs/heads/main/releases/MiyooPod.zip)
2. Extract the MiyooPod.zip file
3. Connect your Miyoo Mini Plus SD card to your computer
4. Copy the `MiyooPod` folder to `/App` on your SD card
5. Safely eject the SD card and insert it back into your Miyoo Mini Plus
6. MiyooPod will appear in your Apps menu

## Adding Songs

MiyooPod reads music files from your SD card's Music folder:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/Media/Music/
```

1. Connect your Miyoo Mini SD card to your computer
2. Navigate to `/Media/Music/` folder
3. Copy your MP3 files and folders into this directory
4. Organize your music by artist/album folders for better library organization
5. Launch MiyooPod - it will automatically scan and index your music library

## Supported Formats

MiyooPod supports **MP3**, **FLAC**, and **OGG/Vorbis** audio files.

**Recommended Format:** MP3 @ 256kbps

- **Format:** MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3)
- **Bitrate:** 256kbps CBR (Constant Bitrate) or VBR V0
- **Sample Rate:** 44.1kHz
- **Channels:** Stereo

> **Note:** The Miyoo Mini Plus audio output is not high quality enough to justify higher bitrate files. Playback might be choppy with higher bitrate files. FLAC files are supported but MP3 is recommended for best performance on the Miyoo Mini's limited hardware.

## Album Artwork

### Embedded Artwork
MiyooPod automatically extracts album art embedded in your MP3 files' ID3 tags.

### Automatic Download from MusicBrainz
For albums without embedded artwork, MiyooPod can automatically fetch album covers:

1. Navigate to **Settings** from the main menu
2. Select **"Fetch Album Art"**
3. MiyooPod will scan your library and download missing album artwork

> **Note:** Requires internet connection via WiFi. Artwork is stored in `/mnt/SDCARD/Media/Music/.miyoopod_artwork/`

## Settings

- **Themes** - Choose from 17 visual themes (Classic iPod, Dark, Dark Blue, Light, Nord, Solarized Dark, Matrix Green, Retro Amber, Purple Haze, Cyberpunk, Coffee, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Neon, Midnight, Gruvbox, Candy)
- **Lock Key** - Customize which button locks/unlocks the screen (Y, X, or SELECT). The Miyoo Mini Plus doesn't support suspend mode natively, so the lock key prevents accidental presses during playback
- **Fetch Album Art** - Automatically download missing album artwork from MusicBrainz
- **Check for Updates** - Manually check for and install OTA updates
- **Update Notifications** - Toggle automatic update prompts on/off
- **Clear App Data** - Reset library cache, settings, and artwork
- **Toggle Logs** - Enable or disable debug logging
- **Rescan Library** - Force a complete rescan of your music library
- **About** - View app version and check for updates

## Technical Details

Built using **Go 1.22.2** with native C bindings (CGO) for graphics and audio.

### Architecture
- **Platform:** Miyoo Mini Plus, Mini v4, Mini Flip / OnionOS
- **CPU:** ARM Cortex-A7 (dual-core)
- **Resolution:** 640×480 native
- **Cross-compilation:** arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc

### Key Libraries
- **SDL2** - Graphics, input handling, window management
- **SDL2_mixer** - Audio playback with MP3 decoding (libmpg123)
- **fogleman/gg** - 2D graphics rendering
- **dhowden/tag** - ID3 tag parsing
- **golang.org/x/image** - Image processing and font rendering

### Performance Optimizations
- Dual-core utilization (UI and audio on separate cores)
- Pre-rendered digit sprites for time display
- Text measurement and album art caching
- Library metadata cached as JSON for fast startup

## Troubleshooting

### App does not launch / crashes on startup

The library cache files may be corrupted. Connect your SD card to your computer and delete the hidden JSON files in the music folder:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/Media/Music/.miyoopod_library.json
/mnt/SDCARD/Media/Music/.miyoopod_state.json
```

MiyooPod will rescan your library on the next launch.

### Album art not displaying correctly

Open **Settings** → **Clear App Data** to wipe the artwork cache and library metadata. MiyooPod will rebuild everything on the next launch. You can then use **Fetch Album Art** again to re-download missing covers.

### Checking logs

If the app is misbehaving, enable logging from **Settings** → **Toggle Logs**, then reproduce the issue and check the log file on your SD card:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/App/MiyooPod/miyoopod.log
```

Attach this file when reporting a bug on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/danfragoso/miyoopod/issues).

### A broken OTA update made the app unusable

If an update left the app in a broken state, manually reinstall the latest version:

1. Download [MiyooPod.zip](https://github.com/danfragoso/miyoopod/raw/refs/heads/main/releases/MiyooPod.zip)
2. Extract and copy the `MiyooPod` folder to `/App` on your SD card, overwriting the existing files
3. Your music library and settings are stored separately and will not be affected

## Building from Source

```bash
# Cross-compile for ARM
make go
```

The build process uses CGO to compile Go source with C bindings and bundles all required shared libraries.
